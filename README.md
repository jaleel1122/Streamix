# ðŸŽ¬ Streamix â€” Movie Search Engine

Streamix is a responsive **movie search engine** built with React.js that lets users search for movies in real time using a public movie database API.
This project represents the next step in my React learning journey, where I moved beyond basic state management and started working with **real-world concepts** like **API integration**, **routing**, and **performance optimization**.


## ðŸ”— Live Demo

## ðŸš€ Features
- Search for movies via external API  
- Optimized search input using **debounce** (donâ€™t fire API calls on every keystroke)  
- Dynamic routing with **React Router** (e.g. movie detail pages)  
- Responsive design for mobile & desktop  
- Loading and error states for better UX  
- Asynchronous **API calls, handling headers / API key securely**


## ðŸŽ¯ What I Practiced
- `useEffect` and side effects (fetching data on dependency change)  
- `useRef` for maintaining non-stateful data (for example, debounce timer or input focus)  
- `useState` for managing UI state: search term, movie list, loading, errors  
- **Debounce** logic for performance  
- Routing (`useParams`, dynamic routes) for detail views  
- Conditional rendering (loading, errors, empty results)  
- Responsive CSS / layout skills 


## ðŸš§ Possible Next Steps
- Add pagination or infinite scroll for results  
- Add filters (by genre, rating, etc.)  
- Cache search results or autocomplete suggestions  
- Improve UI/UX: transitions, animations


Iâ€™m proud of how this turned out â€” it shows how far Iâ€™ve come since my first React app.  
Would love suggestions on where I can optimize further or libraries/tools I should explore next!
